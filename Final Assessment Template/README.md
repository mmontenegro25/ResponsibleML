* **Model implementation code**: [Group 3_Model.ipynb]([https://github.com/mmontenegro25/ResponsibleML/blob/main/Assignment%205/group3_assignment5_updated.ipynb])

## Intended Use
* **Describe the business value of your group‚Äôs best remediated model**: Our group's best remediated model assists mortgage lenders in making more equitable decisions about loan pricing by predicting whether a loan is high-priced, while minimizing demographic biases across race, gender, and age categories.
  
* **Describe how your group‚Äôs best remediated model is designed to be used**: The model predicts whether an applicant would receive a high-priced loan, allowing the lender to monitor disparities, detect potential fairness violations, and adjust practices to promote compliance and equity.
  
* **Describe the intended users for your group‚Äôs best remediated model**: Mortgage risk analysts, compliance officers, fair lending auditors, and regulatory reporting teams.
  
* **State whether your group‚Äôs best remediated model can or cannot be used for any additional purposes**: This model should not be used for final loan approval decisions, criminal justice predictions, insurance assessments, or employment-related evaluations without retraining and thorough validation for new use cases

* **Training data and validation data split**: Of the 180,169 data points, 70% was assigned to the training data and 30% to the validation data. 
* **Number of rows in training and validation data**:

### Quantitative Analysis

#### State the metrics used to evaluate your group‚Äôs best remediated model
- We evaluated our best remediated model using AUC for predictive performance and AIR for fairness across demographic groups, selecting a model that balances accuracy with improved equity.

- Models were assessed primarily with AUC and AIR. See details below:

| Train AUC | Validation AUC | Test AUC |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 0.8305 | 0.8254 | 0.8298 |

**Table X.** AUC values across data partitions. 


| Group               | Validation AIR |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Black vs. White      | 0.791 |
| Asian vs. White      | 1.154 |
| Female vs. Male      | 0.962 |

#### Red Teaming 

- Adversarial examples were used to probe model robustness, revealing inputs that cause prediction degradation and exposing vulnerabilities.
